# Math-Evaluation-Library

## Description

This is an extensive Mathematics Library. It features applications in 

* Arithmetic
* Calculus
* Linear Algebra
* Graphing
* Differentials 
* and more!

It uses the Shunting Yard algorithm to parse input into an Expression tree which is then recursively evaluated to produce the output expression.

## Applications

This library has been used in some of my other projects including:

* [Desktop Calculator](https://github.com/antoniok9130/Advanced-Desktop-Calculator)
* [Math Rest API](https://github.com/antoniok9130/Math-Library-Rest-API)
* [TheTA](https://theta-jhk.firebaseapp.com/)
